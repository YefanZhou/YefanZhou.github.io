**Hi, welcome to my page!**
<br/>
<br/>
My name is Yefan Zhou, I'm a Master's student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. Before starting my master program, I work closely with Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy and Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka at UC Berkeley. I obtained a Bachlor degree at Southeast University supervised by Prof. Luxi Yang.
<br/> 
My research interest lies in 3D Vision and Robotic Grasping.
<br/> 
<br/> 
Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://YefanZhou.github.io/files/CV_4_1.pdf).
