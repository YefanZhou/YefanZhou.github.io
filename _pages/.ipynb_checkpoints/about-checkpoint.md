**Hi, welcome to my page!**
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student in Robotics at [Southeast University, China](https://www.seu.edu.cn).  
I worked with [Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bajcsy/) in the [Human-Assistive Robotic Technologies(HART)](http://hart.berkeley.edu) Laboratory in my junior year as a visiting student at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu).
<br/> 
<br/> 
My research interest lies in the integration of machine vision with motion control, focusing on advanced control for dexterous manipulation.
<br/>

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://YefanZhou.github.io/files/CV_4_1.pdf).
