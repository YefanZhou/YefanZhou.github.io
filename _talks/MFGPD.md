In this work, we propose a multi-fingered grasp pose detection (MF-GPD) algorithm to plan grasps in clutter. My main contributions are:
* Constructed a point-cloud based multi-fingered grasp dataset by rendering depth images from 3DNet object using Pyrender and Open3D library.
* Reproduced and implemented the SOTA point cloud grasp pose detection (GPD) algorithm as a baseline method.
