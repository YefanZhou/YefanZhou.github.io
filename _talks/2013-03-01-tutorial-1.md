In this work, we built and experimentally characterized a compliance-modulating fingertip-inspired tactile sensor using pneumatic sealed elastic membrane and a depth-sensing camera as an add-on to the Baxter robot for scanning a 3D terrain and measuring the distribution of stiffness:
* Applied Point Cloud Library in C++, ROS and a RGBD camera to enable image segmentation, geometry recognition, and Baxter robot arm control.
* Determined an empirical model of the deviceâ€™s force-deformation characteristics based on simplifying Hertz Contact Theory and further accomplished the derivation of stiffness estimation matrices for external contact region.
* Built a software to enable real-time 3D visualization of point cloud registration and integration including stiffness distribution information in mapping
