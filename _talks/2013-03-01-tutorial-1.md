In this work, we built and experimentally characterized a soft fingertip device based on pneumatic sealed soft silicone material and a depth camera as an add-on to the Baxter robot for scanning a 3D terrain and measuring the distribution of stiffness:
* Applied Point Cloud Library in C++, ROS, and a RGBD camera to enable image segmentation, geometry recognition,
and Baxter robot arm control
* Built a software to enable real time 3D visualization of point cloud mapping including stiffness distribution information in probing
* Completed a full testing and identified opportunities for future improvements:
  * a force reconstruction experiment is setup to find the relation between the force and the shape of our device. 
  * the possibility of stiffness estimation is explored.<br/>
