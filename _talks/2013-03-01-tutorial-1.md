In this project, we build a depth camera-Based soft fingertip device which is attached to a robotic arm. Three experiments are designed to explore the property and applica- tion of our device. First, a force reconstruction experiment is setup to find the relation between the force and the shape of our device. Second, the possibility of stiffness estimation is explored. Third, a software to perform 3D-probing is developed.<br/>
