* Leveraged NumPy and PyTorch in Python to build a deep neural network model for 3D object shape (represented by point cloud) reconstruction from a single RGB image; trained the model on ShapeNet.
* Proposed and proved the correlation between clustering tendency of training dataset and performance bias of neural network.
* Leveraged Shrink Wrap modifier and OpenGL renderer in Blender to build an interpolation-based 3D model synthetic dataset.
* Defined a metric to measure the clustering tendency of 3D model dataset based on silhouette score and affinity propagation.
