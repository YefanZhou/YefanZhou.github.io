* Leveraged NumPy and PyTorch in Python to build a deep neural network model (Encoder-Decoder) for 3D object shape (represented by point cloud) reconstruction from a single RGB image; trained the model on ShapeNet and Pix3D: Dataset and Methods for Single-Image 3D Shape Modeling.
* Derived a mathematical model for transformation from point cloud coordinate to image raster space.
* Further improved the reconstruction workflow based on point cloud perceptual loss function constructed by pre-trained encoder and the optimization of local geometric feature represented by k-nearest neighbors covariance.
