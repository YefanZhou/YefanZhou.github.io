The integration of eye gaze system and upper-limb exoskeleton has the potential to motivate a new generation of active assistive device. In this work, we propose a novel and affordable active upper-limb exoskeleton development system focusing on system design and trajectory planning algorithm for eye gaze study. 
* Applied MinimumAngle Jerk Algorithm and Minimum Hand Jerk Algorithm to Upper-limb exoskeleton system so as to realize
Cartesian Space and Joint Space Humanoid Trajectory Planning; implemented the design in MATLAB simulation and
embedded system
* Developed a low-level controller for Upper-limb exoskeleton system positive assistance, using PD controller for joint angle position and velocity control; enabled joint angle sensing based on an encoder and motion actuation based on servo motors and linear actuators.
* Built a MATLAB GUI for exoskeleton system, allowing simulation and 3D visualization of planning algorithm, controller
parameter tuning, real time hardware control and data analysis.
* Developed a low-level passive upper arm assistance controller for driving an Upper-limb exoskeleton system, allowing the
motion of exoskeleton in a horizontal plane to mimic human behavior, with force compensation added; developed a PD control algorithm using mass-spring-damper system for prediction; developed hardware based on Arduino Uno, load cells for sensing and servo motor for actuation.
* Employed SolidWorks and 3D printing to design and manufacture the mechanical parts.<br/>
