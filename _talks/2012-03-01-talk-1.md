The integration of eye gaze system and upper-limb exoskeleton has the potential to motivate a new generation of active assistive device. In this work, we propose a novel and affordable active upper-limb exoskeleton development system focusing on system design and trajectory planning algorithm for eye gaze study. We demonstrate its ability to do position and velocity control both in Cartesian space and Joint space, and show that trajectory planning algorithm can be implemented and validated in this platform. In addition, an intuitive and interactive Graphic User Interface(GUI) are designed for the system with functions of 3D visualization and real-time data analysis. Furthermore, we propose two trajectory planning algorithms that are able to generate motion primitive mim- icking human movement for robot assistance and validate its performance by motion capture camera system and human subject trial test.<br/>
