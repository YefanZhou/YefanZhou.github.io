The aim of the project is to develop trajectory planner and low-level controller for wearable robotic upper limb exoskeleton to assist patientâ€™s arm movement in gaze-based rehabilitation training especially reaching tasks.
* Applied Minimum Angle/Hand Jerk Algorithm to trajectory planner so as to realize Cartesian Space and Joint Space real-time humanoid trajectory planning and execution.
* Developed a PD controller for exoskeleton active assistance, allowing joint angle and end effector position/velocity control. 
* Implemented the planner and controller in MATLAB and on STM32 board; enabled joint angle sensing based on encoders and motion actuation based on servo motors and linear actuators; built in MATLAB a GUI for exoskeleton system, allowing simulation and 3D visualization of planning algorithm, controller parameter tuning, real-time hardware control and data analysis.
* Employed SolidWorks and 3D printing to design and manufacture the mechanical structure.<br/>
